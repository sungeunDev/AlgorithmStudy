# Big-O Notation


Big-O | Name | Description
------| ---- | -----------
**O(1)** | constant | **This is the best.** The algorithm always takes the same amount of time, regardless of how much data there is. Example: looking up an element of an array by its index.
**O(log n)** | logarithmic | **Pretty great.** These kinds of algorithms halve the amount of data with each iteration. If you have 100 items, it takes about 7 steps to find the answer. With 1,000 items, it takes 10 steps. And 1,000,000 items only take 20 steps. This is super fast even for large amounts of data. Example: binary search.
**O(n)** | linear | **Good performance.** If you have 100 items, this does 100 units of work. Doubling the number of items makes the algorithm take exactly twice as long (200 units of work). Example: sequential search.
**O(n log n)** | "linearithmic" | **Decent performance.** This is slightly worse than linear but not too bad. Example: the fastest general-purpose sorting algorithms.
**O(n^2)** | quadratic | **Kinda slow.** If you have 100 items, this does 100^2 = 10,000 units of work. Doubling the number of items makes it four times slower (because 2 squared equals 4). Example: algorithms using nested loops, such as insertion sort.
**O(n^3)** | cubic | **Poor performance.** If you have 100 items, this does 100^3 = 1,000,000 units of work. Doubling the input size makes it eight times slower. Example: matrix multiplication.
**O(2^n)** | exponential | **Very poor performance.** You want to avoid these kinds of algorithms, but sometimes you have no choice. Adding just one bit to the input doubles the running time. Example: traveling salesperson problem.
**O(n!)** | factorial | **Intolerably slow.** It literally takes a million years to do anything.
